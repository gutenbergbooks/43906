<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time
there was a very mischievous
little monkey,
who lived in a big banyan
tree, and his name
was Jacko.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="283" height="226" alt="fierce lion and lioness" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the jungle
below there lived a huge,
fierce old lion and
lioness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 302px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="302" height="388" alt="monkey hanging from tree pulling lions' tails" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Jacko was a very
teasing monkey. He
used to climb down the
long trailing roots of the
banyan tree, and pull the
tails of all the other
creatures, and then
scamper up again, before
they could catch him.</p>

<p>And he was so bold,
he even pulled the tails
of the lion and lioness
one day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 295px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>This made them so
angry that&mdash;</p>

<p>They went to a grim
old bear they knew, and
they arranged with him
that he should come with
them to the banyan tree,
when Jacko was away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>So he came, and standing
on the lion's head,
he gnawed the roots
through till they were
so thin they would not
bear a jerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>And next time Jacko
pulled the lion's tail he
gave a great tug&mdash;the
roots broke, and down
fell Jacko, into the huge,
fierce grim old lion's
jaws!!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="279" height="178" alt="little monkey under lion's paw with lioness watching" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come here, my dear!"
roared the lion.</p>

<p>The lioness came and
looked at Jacko. "He
is a very thin monkey,"
said she; "we had better
put him in the larder for
a week to fatten him,
and then ask Mr. Bear
to dinner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="280" height="367" alt="lions putting monkey in stone &quot;cage&quot;" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>So they put him in the
larder, which was just a
little piece at the end of
their cave, built up with
big stones, and while the
lion built it up, the lioness
lay ready to spring on
him if he tried to escape.
It was very dark and very
cold, and Jacko did not
like it at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="281" height="169" alt="lioness writing leaf-letter" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>They left a little window
to feed him by, and
every day they gave him
as many bananas as he
liked, because they knew
monkeys ate bananas,
and they could get them
easily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="279" height="177" alt="bear writing leaf-letter" />
</div>



<p>Then the lioness wrote
a leaf-letter to the bear,
asking him to dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a><br /><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
which he, of course,
accepted with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="278" height="184" alt="monkey giving extra bananas to rats" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jacko did not get
fat, and the reason of
that was that he soon
tired of bananas, and
only ate one every day.
He gave all the others to
the rats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The lion and lioness
were rather worried because
Jacko did not get
fat, so one day they stole
in to listen to him talking
to the rats, and as it
happened they were just
talking about bananas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am tired of bananas,"
said Jacko. "I wish I
could get a cocoa-nut."</p>

<p>"It would make you
very fat," said the rats.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacko, "and
I don't want to be fat
for those old lions."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" said the
lions. "A cocoa-nut will
make him fat; we'll get
him one at once."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="292" height="383" alt="lions looking up at cocoa-nut tree" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>But when they came
to the tree they could
not reach a single cocoa-nut!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="278" height="351" alt="lion talking to rat in rocks" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>So the lion went back
and told the little rats
<i>very fiercely</i> that he would
tear down the stones, and
eat them all up at once,
if they did not fetch him
down some cocoa-nuts at
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="283" height="371" alt="cocoa-nuts fell on heads of lions" />
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>This terrified the little
rats. They scampered
up the tree, and gnawed
off the cocoa-nuts as fast
as they ever could.</p>

<p>But as the cocoa-nuts
fell on the heads of the
lion and lioness, and hurt
them very much, the
little rats took care to
stay up the tree till it
was dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as their heads
felt a little better, the
lion and lioness took the
cocoa-nuts.</p>

<p>And carried them to
Jacko.</p>

<p>They had to make a
very large hole to put
them in, but they built
it up carefully again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Jacko was very much
delighted to get the
cocoa-nuts, but he had
hard work tearing off the
hairy outside.</p>

<p>However at last he got
it all off. Then he
smashed the cocoa-nuts
with a stone, and drank
the milk, and began eating
the nut; and wasn't
it good after a whole
week of bananas!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 276px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="276" height="269" alt="Jacko is pudgy" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>While he ate it, he
amused himself making
a nice warm coat for
himself of the hairy husk
of the cocoa-nuts, and he
was so busy he did not
notice how much he was
eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="284" height="217" alt="Jacko in his warm coat" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>And when he put his
warm coat on he just
looked fearfully fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="271" height="203" alt="lions looking in the larder" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>And the lion and
lioness peeping in,
thought it was all Jacko,
and they were delighted.</p>

<p>"Isn't he fat and tender?"
they said. "We'll
eat him to-night, and not
wait for Mr. Bear."</p>

<p>And they went out for
a walk, to get a good
appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="287" height="270" alt="Jacko smearing himself with bananas" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Jacko! He did
not eat any more cocoa-nut
after he heard that.
He pulled off his coat,
and smoothed his hair
down with his little paws,
but still he looked fat.</p>

<p>And he smeared himself
all over with bananas
to make the hair lie flat,
but <i>still</i> he looked fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>So he put on his warm
coat again, and lay down,
and cried himself to
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>But you must know
the bear was a very
greedy old bear, and that
very afternoon, while
Jacko was asleep, he
came to have a private
peep at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 282px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>And when he saw him
looking so lovely and fat,
he just could not resist
the temptation, and began
pulling down the
stones as fast as he could,
intending to eat him all
by himself. But he was
an awkward, clumsy old
bear, and all of a
sudden&mdash;</p>

<div class='unindent'>the stones all came down

poor little Jacko, and
scaring him nearly out
of his wits. But he had
the sense to scramble
out as fast as he could.</div>

<p>The lion and lioness
were just coming back,
and when they heard the
noise they came tearing
home like the wind, and
met little Jacko just in
the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>With another fearful
roar, the lioness seized
him in her teeth.</p>

<p>But Jacko was so
round with eating cocoa-nut,
and so slippery with
banana, that he popped
out from between her
teeth, like an orange
seed, and ran on.</p>

he was safe, and scrambling
up the cocoa-nut
tree at a rate which
shook down most of the
cocoa-nuts on to the
heads of the lion and
lioness.</p>
